# Pre-work Study Guide>

## Description

This project provides a study guide that is used to store and recall notes made by a student enroled in a bootcamp on HTML, CSS, Gitbash, Git and Javacript. During its creation, it was also used to explore CSS and JavaScript coding languages through styling the guide and creating results in the console.
